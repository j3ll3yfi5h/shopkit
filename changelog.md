### Updating from v0.9

If you're upgrading from Shopkit 0.9.2 or earlier, you'll have to change some things manually:

- The old Shop page was located at `/content/3-shop`. It has now been changed to `/content/1-shop`. After pulling the updated repo, move your categories and products from `3-shop` to `1-shop`, then delete the `3-shop` directory.
- Since Shopkit is now multilingual, change all your text filenames to something like `.en.txt`.
- In every product's text file, change `Prices:` to `Variants:`.
- In every order's text file, change the order status values to reflect the new values: `pending`, `paid`, or `shipped`.
